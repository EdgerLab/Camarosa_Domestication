- We really only care about 3 TE types:
	- LTR
	- TIR
	- Total
- We may optionally care about the various subtypes of LTR and TIR (superfamilies)
- But for now we will start with the 3 main order levels.

- I believe Pat said we care about 1Kb, 2.5Kb, 5Kb, and 10 KB.
- We probably don't care about intronic but I should not leave that out. For now we will do upstream and downstream.
- I should start by adding one of those dimensions (total @ 10kb) to the table, and generating some simple ssyntelog plot
- I will still need to do the shitty operation of basically adding each index in the HDF5 data to the ortholog table AND THEN using that to get the TE VALUE.
