\begin{abstract}
\textbf{Background:}
% The cultivated strawberry (\textit{Fragaria x ananassa}), unlike most crops, is unique because it is a recent domesticate, formed by the interspecific hybridization of wild octoploid species.
% Here, armed with the availability of a wide-array of genomic and phylogentic resources that include wild diploid, wild octploid, and a high-quality reference genome for \textit{Fragaria x ananassa} we examined the genome for signatures of domestication.
% While previous research has shown that the dominant subgenome possesses the least amount of transposable elements (TEs) and that they are important contributors to genotypic and phenotypic variation, the potential influence of TEs on the domestication of strawberry has been relatively understudied.
% %Transposable elements (TEs) are major forces of genetic mutation and phenotypic diversity.
% %A wide-range of traits in a variety of crop species have been shown to be influenced by transposable elements.
% %This is driven by the capacity of TEs to act as alternative promoters, shuffle gene sequences, or influence methylation and chromatin accessibility dynamics near genes.
% \newline
% \textbf{Results:}
% Here we constructed a TE-pangenome for strawberry and show that although the relative TE content between the wild and domesticated strawberry genomes is quite similar, there are large TE differences around genes that suggest their role in the domestication process.
% We show large transposon dynamics around positionally conserved genes suggesting rapid evolution.
% Additionally, we show that a number of defense, biosynthesis, and development genes are enriched for transposon presence and have high expression, suggesting the co-opting or domestication of TEs during the domestication of strawberry. % (TODO verify this!!!)

%Furthermore Hardigan et al. \cite{Hardigan2020} suggests that ``interspecific complementation, a broader pool of potentially adaptive alleles, and the masking of deleterious mutations could be more important than fixed heterosis'' in strawberry.\\

\section{Background:}
Cultivated garden strawberry (\textit{Fragaria x ananassa} Duchesne ex Rozier, \textit{2n} $=$ 8X $=$ 56) is an allo-octoploid species formed from the hybridization of two New World strawberry species \textit{Fragaria virginiana} and \textit{Fragaria chiloensis}.
It is a major fruit crop; 1,211,090 tonnes were produced in the United States in 2021... TODO.
%(\href{TODO CITE FAOSTAT}{https://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=FAO&f=itemCode\%3A544}) and the US production value was evaluated as \$3,398,943,000 in 2023 (\href{TODO CITE USDA}{https://www.nass.usda.gov/Statistics_by_Subject/result.php?C6E91360-DC42-3C4A-8D5C-1392239A0EAF&sector=CROPS&group=FRUIT%20%26%20TREE%20NUTS&comm=STRAWBERRIES}.
Its initial hybridization occurred in the 18th century in France, which makes strawberry one of the most recent domesticated crop species.
Unlike most domesticated crops, strawberry has not undergone thousands of years of breedings, only about 300 years of breeding.


However the genomic changes associated with domestication have largely remained a mystery as a high-quality reference genome for cultivated strawberry was not available until quite recently \cite{Edger2019} (TODO CITE RR).
These datasets have enabled a wide-array of studies to be performed on the strawberry genome as several research groups have worked on identifying selective-sweep regions, in addition to surveying the genomic diversity, evolutionary history, and structure of the strawberry genome (TODO CITE).
For some time the genetic variation in \textit{Fragaria x ananassa} was considered to be rather limited (TODO CITE), a notion that has been strongly challenged by recent research (TODO CITE HARDIGAN).
In fact, Hardigan et al showed that genomic diversity is actually quite high, both in the wild founder and domesticated populations.
Other hallmarks of domesticated genomes are absent in strawberry such as ... TODO.
Additionally, the genome shows high degree of karyotypic stability and absence of chromosome restructuring \cite{Hardigan2020, Hardigan2021}.


While great strides have been made in such a short time in understanding the genome and genetic diversity of strawberry, the success of strawberry as an agricultural crop is not fully understood.
Its high nucleotide diversity, and limited quantitative evidence of heterosis \cite{Stegmeir2010, Rho2012, Hardigan2020} leads us to suspect that initial breeding efforts may have had more to do with the purification/silencing of deleterious alleles and transposable elements (TEs) rather than the fixation of heterotic loci.
This is in contrast to other crops such as maize, where heterosis is widely known as major contributor to yield TODO CITE, and whose genome has had more time to undergo purifying selection despite its high TE content.


Given that cultivated strawberry is a highly-diverse recent domesticate with limited evidence of heterosis, we hypothesized that the relatively understudied component of plant genomes, transposable elements (TEs), could be playing an active role in the domestication of strawberry.
TEs are selfish, mobile, repetitive DNA sequences that constitute a major component of most eukaryotic genomes.
TEs are great forces of genetic mutation and phenotypic diversity, and are widely known to be predominantly deleterious.
However, TEs can also be beneficial, acting as alternative promoters, shuffling gene sequences, or influencing methylation and chromatin accessibility dynamics near genes.
TEs have been shown to influence a wide-range of traits in a variety of crop species, such as color variation in grape, apple, and pepper, disease resistance in pepper, and the domestication of maize TODO CITE.
They can rapidly amplify in copy number and quickly cause mutations in large portions of the genome.
We hypothesized that the large-scale removal and/or silencing of TEs (whose proliferation may not have faced such strong purifying selection in wild populations) could be a major force in the domestication of strawberry.






In this study, utilizing a comparative genomics framework, we examined the role of transposable elements (TEs) in shaping the genome of cultivated strawberry.
We hypothesized that TEs have played a role in the domestication of strawberry, and that the TE landscape around genes could be contributing to domestication-related phenotypes.
Furthermore, given that 



These examples are exceptions to the rule, as TEs are generally considered to be deleterious.
Although TEs are generally considered to be deleterious, they can also be beneficial, acting as alternative promoters, shuffling gene sequences, or influencing methylation and chromatin accessibility dynamics near genes.
Although these examples are well-documented, the systematic investigation of TEs interacting with genes in strawberry remains to be performed.

We draw comparisons between the wild diploid strawberry (\textit{Fragaria vesca} `H4', \textit{2n} $=$ 2X $=$ 14), the wild octoploid strawberry (\textit{Fragaria chiloensis} `Del Norte', \textit{2n} $=$ 8X $=$ 56), and the cultivated octoploid strawberry (\textit{Fragaria x ananassa} `Royal Royce', \textit{2n} $=$ 8X $=$ 56).

In this study we examine transposable elements


\paragraph{Transposons as Agents of Change:}
Transposable elements (transposons, TEs) are selfish, mobile, repetitive DNA sequences that constitute a major component of most eukaryotic genomes.
Some genomes have a relatively high transposon load, for example, B73, a \textit{Zea mays} line and key component of the Nested Association Mapping (NAM) panel, is $\sim$82.9\% TE \cite{Hufford2021}.
% Wheat, another \texit{Poaeceae} similarly is $\sim$85\% TE \cite{Appels2018}.

TEs can be divided into two classes.
Class I TEs, also known as retrotransposons, mobilize through an RNA intermediate and behave in a ``copy-and-paste'' manner.
Generally LTR elements, an order of Class I elements, are the most common TE type in plants.
Class II elements utilize a DNA intermediate and are ``cut-and-paste''.
Class II elements are less common, and generally not quite as large as LTR elements.

TEs can influence the expression of genes in a multitude of ways.
TEs can pick up and shuffle gene fragments, duplicate nearby sequences, act as novel regulatory features, or completely alter a gene's normal transcription through insertional mutagenesis.
They also have a strong influence on genome structure and chromatin accessibility.
Because of their inherent selfish, mutagenic nature, TEs are frequently targeted with repressive methylation to prevent their transcription.
These repressive marks can sometimes ``spill-over'' to sequences adjacent to the TE due to the self-reinforcing nature of RdDM, influencing the surrounding landscape: woe to any gene nearby.

While most TEs create negative fitness consequences and are typically kept under transcription lock-down, there are a number of example of TEs influencing plants in neutral or positive manners.
For example, TEs have influenced grape color, apple color, pepper disease resistance, metabolite variation, the domestication of maize, and may have a role in subgenome dominance in strawberry (TODO, this part was really close in structure to my paper).
Although previous research has unearthed TEs interacting with genes, or in some cases acting as genes themselves, the systematic investigation of TEs interacting with genes in strawberry remains to be performed.




% They comprise a major component of eukaryotic genomes, especially in plants.
% For example, the \textit{Zea mays} B73 reference genome is $\sim$80\% TE.

\section{Results:}
\subsection{TE Pangenomes Create Comparable Annotations and Show Differences in Whole-Genome TE Content:}
Our first objective was to create a consistent TE annotation for each genome, reducing false positives and negatives, by creating a TE pangenome.
The genomes for Fragaria x ananassa `Royal Royce', Fragaria chiloensis `Del Norte', and Fragaria vesca `H4' were used to generate a TE pangenome with EDTA (CITE).
This resulted in a genome repeat content of 38.28\% for Del Norte, 35.88\% for Royal Royce, and 28.62\% for H4.
Overall, the annotations for the octploid genomes are not all that different, differing by a total of only 2.2\%.
Table \ref{tab:genomes_combined_reduced} shows a summary table of the TE content for the three genomes, with the full version in the supplement (TODO).

\subsection{Domesticated Strawberry is More Gene-Dense and Less TE-Dense}
We hypothesized that the TE content variation around genes could be contributing to domestication-related phenotypes.
In order to investigate the relationship between TE content and phenotypic variation in strawberry, we calculated the TE Density of genes in both genomes.
However, prior to calculating TE Density we determined the average distance between each in order to better inform the choice of window parameters.
We found that Royal Royce has a mean distance ($\mu$) and standard deviation ($\sigma$) of 5.01 and 8.08 KB; Del Norte was greater in both respects: $\mu = 5.20$ KB, $\sigma = 8.64$ KB.
Thus, we decided to utilize 5KB as the primary reference window for the following TE Density analyses.
We generated a histogram of the gene distances for both genomes, available in the supplement (TODO).

% TODO give this a better title or no title at all?
\subsubsection{Dotplots of TE Density Show General Trends of TE Presence:}
To get a sense of the general trends of gene-centric TE content, we first decided to plot the aggregate of our data: the average TE Density of all genes in Royal Royce and Del Norte as a function of measurement window size and location relative to genes (Figures \ref{fig:RR_order_dotplot} and \ref{fig:DN_order_dotplot}).
These graphs largely recapitulated the results from the whole-genome annotation, as we did not see TE Density differences greater than $\sim$ 2.0 - 2.5\% between Del Norte and Royal Royce in any one TE category, window, or distance combination.
Thus, in the aggregate, we do not see large TE differences between the genomes, and our TE Density results are parallel to the trends we see in the whole-genome annotations.

\subsection{Few Functional Enrichments are Shared Between TE-Dense Genes of Wild and Domesticated Strawberry:} \label{sec:shared_unshared_go}
In order to further explore the subtle TE differences reported in our TE pangenome annotations and TE Density dotplots we examined the functional enrichments of the TE-dense genes.
We hypothesized that in the absence of differential selection on TE-gene relationships, the set of TE-dense genes from both genomes would share a large proportion of functional enrichments (GO terms).
However, we observed that the sets from both genomes were enriched for very different GO terms, and had little in common (Figure \ref{fig:go_compare_total_5K}).
Here, we excluded genes with 0 TE Density, and examined the 95th percentile of total TE Density for the 5 KB upstream window of all genes in Royal Royce and Del Norte.
The cutoff value for the 95th percentile was 0.872 and 0.901 respectively, which corresponds to 4360 and 4505 BP TE occupation of those windows.
Applying this cutoff to our dataset yielded 2507 and 2501 genes (NOTE scott cutoff tables).
After identifying these ``super-dense'' genes, we then subsetted our ortholog table to identify their \textit{Arabidopsis} orthologs and perform a GO enrichment analysis.
Supplemental Table \ref{tab:upset_numbers} shows how the number of genes changes as the analysis progressed.

To visualize the results from the GO enrichment analysis we generated an UpSet plot, Figure \ref{fig:go_compare_total_5K} (TODO cite the UpSet package), to display the shared and unique GO terms between the two datasets.
Despite the roughly equal number of genes in both datasets, the majority of the GO terms were unique to Del Norte, 160 unique terms compared to 83, and only 30 were shared with Royal Royce.
Of the 30 shared terms, GO:0006968 (cellular defense response), GO:0006970 (response to osmotic stress), GO:0009408 (response to heat) and GO:0009686 (gibberellin biosynthetic process) were the most eye-catching, but the majority of the shared terms were broad and general.
The full list of shared terms is available in the supplement (TODO supplement).

Moving on to the unique terms, we found that the Del Norte dataset was enriched for 

% Talking about the not necessarily syntenic gene set here, still gotta talk about the syntenic gene set



\subsection{Domesticated Strawberry Has Less TEs Near Its Syntelogs With Wild Strawberry:}
We expected that the syntelog pairs would have similar levels of TE presence, but referencing Figure \ref{fig:syntelog_5000_total} we see rather large differences, and show that the Del Norte syntelog is on average more TE-dense.
% Here we plotted the difference in TE Density values of syntelog pairs, subtracting the Royal Royce value from the Del Norte value.
% The TE Density values reported in Figure \ref{fig:syntelog_5000_total} were derived from a 5 KB measurement window upstream of genes, and display the total TE Density --- the sum of all TE occupied base-pairs for the window.
Before we began statistically investigating this relationship, we first plotted the quantile-quantile (QQ) plot to assess the normality of the distribution.
The QQ plot showed that the data likely does not come from a normal distribution, and suggests that the data contains more extreme values than a normal distribution (TODO supplement).

Thus, we decided to move forward with a nonparametric test.
% TODO CHECK THIS STATEMENT ON WHAT EXACTLY A WILCOXIN IS IN CASE A STATS PERSON TRIES TO GRILL ME
We performed a Wilcoxon signed-rank test to test the null hypothesis ($H_{0}$) that TE Density values of the syntelog pairs come from the same distribution, and set a one-sided alternative hypothesis ($H_{a}$) positing that the Del Norte values are consistently greater than Royal Royce.
This test was performed on the 5KB upstream window, considering all TEs.
The mean TE Density difference was calculated as 0.032, which translates to a 161.6 BP bias in total TE content towards Del Norte.
Our resulting p-value of 2.730e-164 allows us to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative.

We repeated this analysis for all TE types, over all windows, for both upstream and downstream, and found that there is no combination in which the Royal Royce syntelogs are more TE-dense (TODO supplement).
% TODO remove this sentence?
We also observed that the mean is always positive and that the absolute value of the 95th percentile cutoffs are consistently greater for the Del Norte-biased portion of the graphs.
Table \ref{tab:syntelog_summary} shows a summary of the syntelog TE Density differences for additional TE categories and measurement windows.
Of particular interest were CACTA elements, a superfamily of TIR elements, as they had some of the largest syntelog TE Density differences.
This category also displayed one of the largest differences in whole genome annotation between Del Norte and Royal Royce, 1.02\%, second only to unknown LTR elements (Table \ref{tab:genomes_combined_reduced}).
% It is worth noting that the generally large size of CACTA elements, which could impact their identification rate, proclivity to be near genes and or silenced and degraded, or other factors.

\subsection{Domesticated Strawberry Has Less TE Density Around Flowering, Fruit and Sugar Related Syntelogs:}
Next we decided to look at the TE Density of the syntelogs that had the greatest differences in TE Density --- the tails of Figure \ref{fig:syntelog_5000_total}.
We found that flowering, fruit, and sugar related GO terms were enriched in the Del Norte syntelogs, and that the Royal Royce syntelogs had terms associated with development and defense.

%\subsection{GO Annotations of the Syntelogs Greatly Differing in TE-Density Suggest that... }
%Next, we investigated the tails of Figure \ref{fig:syntelog_2500_total}, and its sister datasets to examine what kinds of functional enrichments exist for the syntelogs that greatly differ in TE density.
%We asked ourselves, ``What kinds of genes would have high TE density in the domesticated genome but hardly any in the wild genome?'' and vice-versa.
%First

%\subsection{Gene Comparisons TODO RETITLE:}
%\paragraph{Domesticated and Wild Strawberry Share Few GO Terms Among Their TE-Dense genes:}
%Next, we performed a GO enrichment on the TE-dense genes of each genome, regardless of whether or not that gene had a corresponding syntelog or large TE difference between the genomes (TODO most do because we had to get AT orthologs).
%Here we sought to compare and contrast the GO terms of the TE-dense genes to see if there were gene ontologies that are unique or shared between the genomes.

\subsection{TE-Dense Genes Exhibit Reduced Rates of Ortholog Identification:}
Generating functional enrichments of genes of interest is a fundamental step in analyzing genomic data and drawing conclusions about their biological significance.
Here we show that the TE-dense genes are less likely to have orthologs with closely-related strawberry species, as well as \textit{Arabidopsis} orthologs, when compared to a random sampling (10,000 iterations) of genes.
Figure \ref{fig:ortholog_survival_rate_barplot} shows the wild diploid strawberry ortholog and \textit{Arabidopsis} ortholog identification rates for the 95th-percentile of TE-dense genes in domesticated strawberry, and a random sampling of genes of the same size.
The random sample (n = 5,065 genes) identified an \textit{Arabidopsis} for 2,986 (58.96\%) of the genes, while the TE-dense genes (n = 5,065 genes) identified an \textit{Arabidopsis} ortholog for 1,801 (35.56\%) of the genes.
This ortholog identification rate for the TE-dense genes was -34.386 standard deviations away from the mean of the random sample (TODO supplement).
We repeated this analysis for the LTR and TIR datasets and had similar results; although the 95th percentiles for LTR and TIR were lower, and the ortholog identification rates were slightly higher.


Out of a concern that a greater portion of TE-dense genes may actually be TEs annotated as genes (false positives) and/or poorly supported or noisy gene models, and thus biased towards not having an ortholog, we filtered both the random sample and TE-dense genes to only include those with an AED score of less than or equal to 0.75.
This did not remove many genes from the dataset, and the ortholog identification rates remained consistent with the unfiltered dataset.
Histograms of the AED scores for all genes for all genomes are available in the supplement (TODO supplement).

The ortholog identification rates are shown for the wild diploid (H4) strawberry and \textit{Arabidopsis}. Genes in both the random-sample and TE-dense set were filtered to exclude those with an AED score greater than 0.75. The 95th percentile cutoff evaluated to a TE Density value of 0.872 (4360 BP) for the upstream 5KB window.}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Deeply Conserved Genes Have Reduced TE Density:}
To complement our findings on the ortholog identification rates of TE-dense genes, we examined the TE Density of genes with \textit{Arabidopsis} orthologs.
At a broad-scale, we found that the TE Density of genes with \textit{Arabidopsis} orthologs was consistently lower than the TE Density of genes without \textit{Arabidopsis} orthologs.
Supplemental Figure (TODO supplement) shows the general pattern of TE Density of all genes, similar to Figure \ref{fig:RR_order_dotplot}, but each TE grouping is downshifted in their TE Density values.

We also performed a MannWhitneyU test.
Our null hypothesis ($H_{0}$) was that the two groups are equal in their TE Density, and our alternative hypothesis ($H_{a}$) was that the TE Density of genes with \textit{Arabidopsis} orthologs is less than the TE Density of genes without \textit{Arabidopsis} orthologs.
Our resulting p-value was 0 (TODO SCOTT rounding error in code?), the 







\section{Discussion:}
\paragraph{Limitations of our TE Annotations:}
Without extensive manual annotation, TE annotations generated from software alone are ultimately a hypothesis of the identification and classification of TEs in a genome.
The structural diversity of TEs, the quality of input genomes, the availability of reference data sets such as TE models and consensus sequences, the performance of \textit{de novo} annotation software, and the difficulty in manually verifying individual TE models comes together to limit the interpretation and tractability of TE annotations. 
For example, Helitron elements are notoriously difficult to analyze due to their structural assymetry, a lack of TSD upon integration and high sequence heterogeneity (TODO cite Helitron book chapter), for this reason they were left unanalyzed.

\paragraph{Shared GO Terms:}
In Section \ref{sec:shared_unshared_go} we showed that the TE-dense genes of the two genomes were enriched for very different GO terms, and had little in common.
We did not find the set of shared terms particularly interesting save for a few terms.
However, GO:000940 (response to heat), was of particular interest due to previous research by Lisch et al (SCOTT CITE, go to twitter DM with Pat) in \textit{Zea mays}, and previous research that shows the activation of TEs under stress conditions (TODO).
They showed that heat stress can reverse transcriptional silencing of TEs in DNA methylation deficient (RdDM specifically) mutants, as heat stress would reduce the amount of repressive histone modifications to the terminal inverted repeats of \textit{MuDr} elements.
If there are genes with nearby TEs possessing aberrant or weakly imposed DNA methylation patterns, then it would make sense that this GO term showed up in both datasets.


\paragraph{Limitations of TE Density:}
TODO?

\paragraph{Limitations of GO:}
The ability to infer gene function in strawberry is ultimately limited by our ability to infer orthology to \textit{Arabidopsis thaliana}.
Futhermore, not every \textit{Arabidopsis} gene is associated with a GO term.
Thus, it is entirely possible we are missing functional annotations more pertinent to strawberry domestication and agriculture, because the strawberry genes have diverged and/or acquired new functions not in the \textit{Arabidopsis} data set.

\subsection{TE Annotation:} \label{sec:EDTA_methods}
The genomes for Fragaria x ananassa `Royal Royce', Fragaria chiloensis `Del Norte', and Fragaria vesca `H4' were used to generate a TE pangenome with EDTA (CITE).
First, Royal Royce was annotated with EDTA v2.1.1 using the \verb|--sensitive 1| and \verb|--anno 1| flags to obtain a RepeatMasker output, due to issues with running EDTA v2.2.1 on Royal Royce.
Then each strawberry genome was individually annotated with EDTA v2.2.1, using the \verb|--sensitive 1| and \verb|--anno 1| flags; and the RepeatMasker output from the Royal Royce annotation was used as an additional optional input for that genome only.
Third, a pangenome repeat library was created by calling \verb|panEDTA.sh| on a directory containing the results from the individual annotations.
Finally, the pangenome library was used to re-annotate the individual genomes.

\subsection{TE Density Calculation:} \label{sec:density_methods}
TE Density (CITE) v2.2.1 was used to generate TE Density with default parameters using the EDTA-produced TE annotations.
Some modifications were made to the EDTA-produced TE annotations during the preprocessing stage of the TE Density pipeline; these modifications collapsed TE-family level groupings into the same TE superfamily, as consistent with the guidelines of the TE Density software.
These changes may be found within the \verb|import_strawberry_EDTA.py| script, available within the GitHub repository.





\subsection{Ortholog Identification:} \label{sec:methods_orthologs}
Genome-wide analyses using a combination of synteny- and reciprocal BLASTp- based approaches, were performed to identify orthologs amongst the strawberry genomes.
Ortholog pairs were excluded if they did not reside on homologous (TODO check term) chromosomes, i.e a gene pair from chromosome 1-4 in the Royal Royce genome was excluded from having a Del Norte ortholog on chromosome 2-3.
Data from Hardigan (CITE) was used to establish the chromosome relationships between Del Norte and Royal Royce.
Ortholog pairs with E-values greater than or equal to 0.05 were excluded from both datasets.
In the event that SynMap or BLASTp returned multiple genes for a single gene, the ortholog pair with the best (lowest) E-value score was kept, and the other pairs discarded.
In the event that a gene had an ortholog identified through both BLASTp and SynMap, we gave priority to the SynMap synteny results, preferentially keeping that ortholog pair. 

Orthologs between H4 and Arabidopsis, similarly identified using a combination of synteny and BLASTp approaches, were used to establish Arabidopsis orthology.
(TODO PAT, more detail here?)
GO terms were acquired from TAIR via the GOSLIM data set, versioned to March 1st, 2023 (cite).
TopGO v2.50.0 was used within R v4.2.2 to generate the GO enrichments.

\subsubsection{Single Copy Ortholog Identification:} \label{sec:methods_single_copy}
A list of genes retained as single copy orthologs (SCOs) over deep evolutionary time was acquired from \textit{De Smet et al.} \cite{DeSmet2013}.
These genes were then intersected with our ortholog table to identify the SCOs in the strawberry genomes.


\paragraph{Syntelog Identification with SynMap:} \label{sec:methods_syntelogs}
First, \href{https://genomevolution.org/CoGe/SynMap.pl}{SynMap} was run between the Del Norte and Royal Royce genome to identify syntelogs.
Then SynMap was run between the Royal Royce and H4 genomes.
In both cases SynMap was run with all default options, except for the fact that `Merge Syntenic Blocks` was set to `Quota Align Merge`.

The analysis of Royal Royce vs. H4 can be retrieved with the following \href{https://genomevolution.org/r/1r9uy}{link}.
% TODO the genomes are private on CoGe currently, is this an issue?

\paragraph{Homolog Identification with BLASTp} \label{sec:methods_homologs}
BLAST v2.2.26 was used to identify homologs that may have been missed using a synteny-based approach.
Specifically, we used `blastall -p blastp` to perform the search.
