1. Index the genome with STAR
2. Trim the reads
3. Align the reads with STAR
# TODO verify the samtools, may no longer be needed
3.1 Sort the reads with samtools
4. Quantify the reads with HTSeq
5. Collate the reads into one table of counts
# TODO verify the need to collate, may no longer be needed.
