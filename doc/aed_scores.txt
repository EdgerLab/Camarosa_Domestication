But maybe a note of caution here - with DelNorte we were trying to capture evidence for horizontally transferred  genes and gene copy divergence associated with salinity resistance, so the evidence put into maker here was quite diverse (including a wide range of gene models and about 4 different Vesca annotations). Royal Royce was also annotated using maker, but with a set of polished RR-specific transcripts (selected by Mikado).  Since AED measures divergence between all forms of evidence and final gene models, the AED score distribution is expected to be broader for DN (with many sources of evidence) than for RR (with a single source of evidence).

The rule of thumb I've seen is AED <=0.25 = Pristine model, <=0.5 Very Good Model, <0.75 Acceptable mode, >=0.75 probably reject these models.
